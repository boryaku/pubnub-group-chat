This Portlet allows Liferay users 6.0.5 and above (I wrote it against 6.1) to have a Group Chat client that uses PubNub as the messaging service.
The portlet maintains independent channels per page and uses the group name and the page the portlet is on to create a unique channel,
I used this instead of the primary keys so we can support clustering.

The porlet displays the users name and the user's profile picture in the chat window associated to their corresponding chat message.
The portlet has a configuration setup page where you put in your Pub and Sub keys and you can optionally tell the portlet to secure the channel.
The portlet will run out of the box but it's using the demo/demo "chat" channel for PubNub so please sign up and configure the portlet.
Also note that you will need to configure each portlet  this was intentional as you can have multiple Accounts with PubNub and you can have
multiple Organizations with Liferay so it made sense to leave it this way.


To Build the Portlet you will need Maven http://maven.apache.org/

Once you have Maven you then simply type "mvn install" and in the webapp/target directory you will have the war file
to deploy to Liferay.

Here's instructions on installing and configuring the Portlet.
